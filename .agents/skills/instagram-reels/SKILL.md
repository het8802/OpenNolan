# Instagram Reels

## Core principle
Treat short-form as **attention engineering**, not video summarization. The first 2–5 seconds must combine a visual hook, spoken hook, and audio/SFX cue; the rest must reward the hook with useful, emotionally legible payoff.

## Source library learned from Het's shared Instagram posts
These are distilled from posts/reels Het explicitly said to “Learn this.” Update this section whenever Het shares more legit Instagram creators/posts.

### Reusable hook families
Use these four hook families instead of rewriting from scratch:

| Family | When to use | What it should do |
|---|---|---|
| Tips/Tools | Tactical AI tools, workflows, prompt systems, startup playbooks | Create a save-worthy how-to for cold followers |
| Storytelling | Personal founder lessons, failures, experiments, credibility | Build trust and human bond |
| Mindset | Founder/operator worldview, contrarian beliefs, identity | Signal authority and attract aligned people |
| Psychological | Myth-busting, pattern interrupt, debate bait, surprising stats | Trigger attention, comments, and rewatch |

### Topic + angle before hook
Before writing hooks, validate:
1. **Topic:** What is the concrete AI/tech/startup signal?
2. **Angle:** Why should a founder/operator care today?
3. **Viewer tension:** What anxiety, opportunity, status move, or practical gain does it touch?
4. **Format:** Is this best as news teardown, tutorial, myth-bust, list, story, or checklist?

Do not open with “X launched Y” unless that phrasing itself creates tension. Convert news into founder/operator implications.

### Retention psychology / Instagram algorithm model
Use this as the operating model for future lessons Het shares about engaging Reels. Preserve new psychology/algorithm observations here or in a narrow sub-skill, not only in chat memory.

- Instagram distribution is behavior-led: prioritize watch time, completion rate, replays, shares per view, saves per view, and comment intent. Likes are weaker than retention/share signals.
- The first seconds must create an **open loop**: a surprising claim, status threat, hidden mechanism, unfinished framework, or visible transformation. The viewer should feel “I need the next beat.”
- Retention comes from **micro-payoffs** every 1–2 seconds: new proof, contradiction, visual change, numbered step, UI reveal, or pattern interrupt.
- Shares come from identity and utility: make viewers think “my founder/AI friend needs this” or “this makes me look smart/helpful.”
- Saves come from structured artifacts: checklists, frameworks, prompt stacks, workflow maps, before/after systems, exact tool chains.
- Comments come from controlled tension: contrarian but defensible claims, myth-busting, “which would you choose?”, or naming a common mistake.
- Rewatch comes from dense but legible pacing: enough information that a second watch is useful, not so much that the first watch is confusing.
- Visual attention resets should be meaningful, not random: motion should clarify the idea or advance the story.

### First 2–5 seconds: visual + spoken + SFX
Every Reel script should specify:
- **Visual hook brick:** movement, prop, A/B comparison, screen recording, crash zoom, match cut, frame collage, unusual first image, etc.
- **Spoken hook brick:** contrarian, problem, warning, secret reveal, case study, list, question, ranking, scenario.
- **Audio/SFX cue:** whoosh, bass hit, stamp, notification ping, silence, cash register, glitch, etc.

Example: `A-vs-B sticky notes + contrarian/problem + stamp SFX` → “AI assistant ❌ / Invoice chaser ✅”.

### Greg Isenberg / Roberto Nickson short-form production system
Learned from Greg Isenberg's public Roberto Nickson masterclass and X thread (Oct 2025): the polished "programmatic" look is mostly a **templated assembly line**, not a magic one-click generator. Reusable rules:
- Script first for tension: line 1 hooks; line 2 introduces conflict; then alternate context/conflict.
- Record quickly with teleprompter; do not over-optimize the take.
- Edit like dopamine engineering: something changes every few seconds—jump cut, caption hit, pattern interrupt, screen-recording move, generated B-roll, SFX.
- Use contextual generated visuals instead of generic stock when possible. Publicly cited stack includes Apple Notes, Prompter Pro, OBS, Screen Studio, Downie, optimized Premiere workflow, Nano Banana, Kling, Sora 2; Greg has also cited ChatGPT + Veo/CapCut/Final Cut and Remotion-inside-Codex in related posts.
- Key implementation lesson for Het: Remotion/FFmpeg should be used as a deterministic assembler around a strong design system, shot vocabulary, captions, B-roll, and sound design—not as a blank React canvas that invents taste on demand.

#### Greg-style Remotion implementation for Het
Use this when Het asks for Greg Isenberg-like Instagram Reels, Hyperagent-style AI product reels, or clean editorial programmatic videos.

- Demo QA contact sheet: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-demo/contact-sheet-final.jpg`

**Existing reusable assets:**
- Fonts: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/fonts/Fraunces/` and `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/fonts/Inter/` from Google Fonts OFL. Use Fraunces or Georgia-like serif for editorial hooks; Inter/DM Sans-like sans for UI labels.
- Palette: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/palettes/greg-editorial.json`.
- Backgrounds: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/backgrounds/warm-paper.png`, `subtle-noise.png`, `mint-gradient.png`.
- Icons: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/icons/robot-agent.svg`, `document.svg`, `checklist.svg`, `map-pin.svg`, `browser.svg`, `dollar.svg`, `cursor.svg`.
- Shapes: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/shapes/dashed-container.svg`, `pill-label.svg`, `rounded-node.svg`, `progress-bar.svg`.
- SFX placeholders: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/sfx/soft-pop.wav`, `whoosh.wav`, `click.wav`, `riser.wav`. Replace with ElevenLabs/generated SFX when keys exist.
- Starter components: `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit/templates/*.tsx` (`workflow-diagram`, `multi-agent-map`, `truth-card`, `ai-output-card`, `talking-head-quote`, etc.).

**Asset provenance / how the first kit was created:**
- Background PNGs were generated locally: warm paper base, subtle noise overlay, mint gradient.
- SVG icons/shapes were drawn as original simple vector primitives using the Greg-style palette; do not copy Greg's actual thumbnails/assets.
- Fonts are open Google Fonts. The Fraunces + Inter pairing recreates the editorial serif + clean product UI contrast.
- SFX were simple local synthesized placeholders because `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` / `XI_API_KEY` was missing.
- The 10s demo was built in Remotion at 1080×1920, 30fps, 300 frames, then verified with `npm run lint`, `ffprobe`, `ffmpeg -f null`, black-frame detection, and contact-sheet visual QA.

**Design schema / visual grammar:**
- Canvas: vertical 9:16, 1080×1920, off-white warm paper. Avoid black/cyberpunk unless the script explicitly needs contrast.
- Core colors from `greg-editorial.json`: `paper #F5EFE6`, `paperWarm #F7EDE7`, `mint #9FD8B5`, `mintStrong #68B894`, `teal #4FAE91`, `forest #173D35`, `forestDeep #0E2B25`, `coral #D96D5F`, `gold #F4C84A`, `mauve #B98BB8`, `charcoal #111111`, `gray #898984`, `whiteWarm #FFF8EC`.
- Color semantics: forest = authority/text; mint/teal = AI/product/building; coral = failure/rejection/warning, use rarely; gold = save/payoff/badge; mauve = secondary UI border/shadow.
- Typography: oversized Fraunces/serif hooks with tight line height (0.9–0.96) and negative letter spacing; Inter/sans for pills, labels, UI nodes, captions.
- Layout: large headline in upper-left; 72–90px safe margins; secondary UI object lower-right; avoid center-stacking everything. Preserve negative space.
- Motifs: rounded product cards, pill labels, dashboard/browser frames, dashed connector paths, workflow nodes, small agent mascots, cursor movement, progress bars, checklist bars.
- Motion grammar: soft spring pop on node reveal; dashed connector draw-on; micro push-in on each scene; caption phrase pop; cards slide 40–70px then settle; dashboard scan/cursor pass; final checklist stagger.
- Transitions: prefer quick 4–8 frame fades/wipes or object-driven transitions. Avoid long crossfades that create ghosted unreadable frames. Always contact-sheet QA.

**When creating new assets from scratch:**
- Use existing SVGs/shapes for generic UI metaphors; create new simple SVGs only when the concept is abstract/systemic (agent, workflow, checklist, database, money, browser, map).
- For specific topical images inside the reel—founder portrait style, product scene, unusual metaphor, B-roll still, cinematic object, company/product illustration—prefer **Codex CLI with native `$imagegen` / image-generation capability** to create AI-generated images, then use Remotion as the assembler. Do not default to hand-coded placeholder art for these topical assets.
- For storyboards or “help me visualize the whole video” deliverables, do **not** default to a PIL/HTML/programmatic contact sheet as the final visual unless the user asks for deterministic wireframes. Create a text beat sheet if useful, then use native `$imagegen` to produce a polished AI-generated storyboard/contact sheet in the editorial AI-product style.
- Store generated topical assets under the project, e.g. `/home/ubuntu/<reel-project>/public/generated/` with descriptive names and a small `asset-ledger.json` recording prompt, source, and usage.
- Treat text embedded in AI-generated images as decorative/background unless it is clearly legible after mobile QA; add primary readable text as Remotion overlays.
- Keep copyrighted/reference material out of the final. Use Greg/other creators as style references only; recreate schema, not assets.

**Remotion build pattern:**
1. Scaffold or reuse a project: `npx create-video@latest --yes --blank --no-tailwind <project>` then `npm i`.
2. Copy or symlink `/home/ubuntu/greg-style-kit` into `public/greg-style-kit`.
3. Register a 1080×1920, 30fps composition. For 10s: `durationInFrames={300}`.
4. Load fonts in CSS from `../public/greg-style-kit/fonts/...`.
5. Build scenes as deterministic components: background, headline card, workflow map, dashboard mock, proof frame, final checklist.
6. Use `spring()` and `interpolate()` with clamped ranges. Keep transitions short and test frame timing.
7. If scene components use absolute frame gates (`sceneOpacity(f, start, end)`), do **not** wrap them in `<Sequence from={...}>` unless you normalize the child frame; Remotion shifts `useCurrentFrame()` inside sequences and can produce blank/empty scenes. Either render absolute-timed scenes directly or make each scene timeline local.
8. Render stills first (`npx remotion still <Comp> --frame=<n> --scale=0.25`) before full MP4, including at least one mid/late scene to catch timing bugs.
9. Render MP4 with h264 (`npx remotion render <Comp> out.mp4 --codec=h264 --crf=18`).
10. Verify: `npm run lint`; `ffprobe`; `ffmpeg -v error -i out.mp4 -f null -`; blackdetect; create a contact sheet and visually inspect.
11. Reference implementation for turning a daily AI/tech script into a 27s Greg-style informational Reel: `references/openai-credits-greg-remotion-reel.md`.
12. Reference implementation for turning a source Reel + drafted script into a 49s Greg-style OpenAI Ads Manager Reel with VO, scene structure, project path, and QA commands: `references/openai-ads-greg-remotion-reel.md`.

**Captivation / retention overlay:**
- Every 1–2 seconds, something meaningful must change: headline state, card reveal, connector draw, dashboard fill, cursor pass, caption hit, visual proof, or SFX.
- Each visual beat should answer “why should I keep watching?” not just decorate the script.
- Use the expectation-vs-reality loop: set an obvious expectation, then beat it with a non-obvious mechanism, example, or contradiction.
- Make visuals save-worthy: frameworks, checklist, workflow maps, before/after, dashboard proof, exact steps.
- Add contrast beats: warm calm design + one coral/red “failure” or “wrong way” moment increases emotional legibility.
- If using voiceover later, align visual reveals to sentence turns, not arbitrary seconds.
- For Greg-style programmatic reels with VO, do not narrate every on-screen word. Rewrite to a tight creator-native VO, choose an energetic social voice, process the VO to video length, then mux with the Remotion export. See `references/openai-credits-greg-remotion-reel.md` for the ElevenLabs timing/muxing pattern and the `-shortest` early-audio pitfall.

### Source-backed evidence montage Reel
Learned from 100xEngineers Reel `DYhssDhN-ti` (May 2026): use `source-backed-reel-evidence-montage` when a Reel needs narration tightly supported by source screenshots, highlighted article text, product clips, terminal/code proof, official notes, and talking-head authority. Core lesson: every factual phrase should map to a visible proof asset; article screenshots should show source context first, then crop/highlight the exact supporting words.

### “Same tool, better setup” AI-design skills Reel
Learned from Nate Herk Reel `DYU6TXpDxtt` / TikTok `7639793885929164045` (May 2026): “Stop making boring designs with Claude Code. Master these 3 skills!”

Reusable hook + structure:
- Hook: “If your Claude Code designs look average, it’s not Claude. It’s your setup.” This reframes blame from model capability to operator setup.
- Structure: numbered skill list (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`) + talking head + fast design-reference cuts + visible proof of polished websites/UI examples.
- Retention device: each skill names a concrete missing capability, then shows visual proof immediately.
- CTA/positioning: “Same tool, completely different output” — sell the setup/system, not a new model.

The three actual skills are saved in `claude-code-design-skills`:
1. Emil Kowalski design = motion/easing/microinteractions so UI feels alive.
2. Impeccable design = layout/spacing/typography cleanup in one design-polish pass.
3. Taste Skill = real design references so AI stops generating generic websites.

Use this pattern for Het’s AI/tooling content when the lesson is: the tool is not enough; the workflow/context/reference system creates the quality gap.

#### InsiderForce kinetic whiteboard caption style
Learned from InsiderForce Reel `DYxBWLIHFM5` (May 2026), “Three Claude Code skills that make you look like a designer overnight.” Use when Het wants a clean faceless AI/design Reel where text, VO, and product mockups carry the whole video.

Reusable visual grammar:
- Background: matte off-white/very light gray with faint grid/texture, subtle watermark, and soft drop shadows. Use sparse decorative brand props (red starburst/sun icon, grayscale 3D hand/object, key, black circular logo badge) as parallax/background accents.
- Typography: bold black condensed/geometric sans for key nouns; light gray trailing words for unrevealed/secondary caption text. Use all-caps for section titles and emphasized payoff words.
- Caption motion: each voiceover clause appears as kinetic typography. The current word/phrase snaps or slides into high-contrast black while nearby unfinished words are gray/blurred. Important phrases get a short black pill/highlight or enlarged stacked words (`HUMAN DESIGNER`, `AESTHETIC OPINION`, `/polish`, `FOLLOWERS`).
- Layout: keep generous negative space; anchor text center/top-left depending on beat; pair explanatory bullets on one side with a floating phone/UI card on the other. Cards float with 3D-ish shadows and small scale/position changes.
- Transition language: quick blur/zoom wipes between sections; vertical card swipes; object-driven slides; no talking head required. Motion should feel like a clean animated presentation deck rather than stock B-roll.
- Beat structure: hook title builds word-by-word → numbered skill card → problem list → solution/payoff phrase → repeat for 3 skills → keyword CTA/product mockup → follow-gate ending.
- Replication note: in Remotion/HyperFrames, implement text as tokenized timed spans with per-token opacity/translate/blur, not ordinary subtitles. Align each phrase reveal to VO word timings; add micro SFX/pop/whoosh on section titles, bullets, and card entrances.
- Smoothing technique learned from the first OpenMontage/HyperFrames replica: avoid meme-like `0.09s` scale yoyo pops, large `translateY`, heavy blur, and `back.out` card overshoot. Use a premium soft-settle instead: reveal key words over roughly `0.28–0.36s`, begin `0.06–0.10s` before spoken stress, limit initial y motion to `12–18px`, blur to `2–3px`, scale payoff text only to `1.03–1.04`, then settle to `1.0` over `0.18–0.25s`; start floating-card ambient drift only after entrance animations settle.
- OpenMontage implementation note: when Het asks to turn this into an OpenMontage reusable style, create both a Layer 2 creative skill and a YAML style playbook, validate the style schema, and update OpenMontage's skill index. When he asks for the actual video, use the HyperFrames production run/pitfall checklist in `references/openmontage-kinetic-whiteboard-captions.md` before rendering and delivering the MP4 + QA contact sheet. Pay special attention to the smoother-motion pitfall: avoid abrupt yoyo pops and bouncy proof-card entrances; use slower soft-settle word/payoff reveals and delayed ambient drift for the premium whiteboard vibe.

Why it works:
- The viewer gets a readable “animated notes” version of the voiceover, but only the key words dominate, so it avoids subtitle fatigue.
- Every 0.5–1.5 seconds something changes: word reveal, bullet addition, phone/card movement, blur wipe, or title reset.
- The white background and repeated brand props create continuity while UI mockups provide proof and topic specificity.

#### Pixel RPG product explainer style
Learned from Reel `DY5SPASumP8` (May 2026): use when Het wants an OpenMontage/HyperFrames/Remotion AI-tool tutorial that feels like a playable mini-world rather than a plain SaaS explainer. Full session reference: `references/dy5spas-pixel-rpg-product-explainer.md`.

Reusable visual grammar:
- Hook with a top-down pixel/RPG world-state: avatar, old computer/tool node, purple crystal/quest object, beige tile/off-white map, and threat labels (`Layoffs`, `Automation`, `Budget Cuts`, `Competition`) radiating from a cracked portal.
- Turn proof into layered desktop windows: browser/news/report cards slide in from different edges, overlap with soft shadows, and highlight only one phrase per card.
- Teach with a level system: `There are 3 levels` → connection diagram → trend map → prompt/result loop → checklist/plan/proof board.
- Use editorial serif kinetic captions as phrase collages, not bottom subtitles. Key nouns get mint/purple/coral color hits and tiny scale emphasis; setup words stay smaller/black/italic.
- Prompt bars are hero UI objects: black rounded pill, green rim glow, app icons, typed prompt text, result card above.
- Transform AI output into tangible artifacts: 7-day checklist, 30-day plan, post grid, profile/proof board. The final payoff should be proof-of-work/identity, not a generic CTA.
- Motion vocabulary: `rpg-walk`, `portal-crack`, `desktop-window-stack`, `phrase-collage-build`, `keyword-color-hit`, `dotted-connector-draw`, `radial-tag-populate`, `prompt-bar-type`, `response-to-artifact`, `proof-grid-land`.
- OpenMontage implementation created from this session: `skills/creative/pixel-rpg-product-explainer.md` and `styles/pixel-rpg-product-explainer.yaml` in `/home/ubuntu/projects/OpenMontage`; validate with the style schema and `load_playbook('pixel-rpg-product-explainer')` before use.

Why it works:
- It makes an abstract AI workflow feel spatial and game-like: connect, prompt, retrieve, plan, publish.
- It alternates light map/caption scenes with dark UI/proof scenes for attention resets.
- It preserves utility: product screenshots and generated artifacts prove the workflow instead of decorating it.

### Low-friction “hooks that always work” phrase bank
Learned from Richard Ens Jr / @richardensjr Reel `DWzni9xEcxL` (Apr 6, 2026): the Reel is a simple save-bait list with creator holding up 10 fingers + cover text “10 hooks that always work,” then one hook phrase per beat. Use these as **opening phrase shells**, not final scripts; adapt them to AI/tech/founder stakes with a concrete payoff in the next line.

Reinforced by Het-shared Claude prompt carousel `DYeB85-CHph` / slide 3: when a morning script hook feels flat, run a **5-angle hook rewrite pass** before finalizing. Rewrite the same core idea as: (1) bold claim, (2) personal confession/experiment, (3) surprising stat or quantified shift, (4) direct question, and (5) “you’ve been doing X wrong” correction. Pick the version with the clearest founder/operator tension, then make the next line immediately prove it so it does not feel like clickbait. Session detail and retrieval fallback: `references/claude-content-prompts-dyeb85.md`.

Reinforced by Het-shared @marketing.shekhar carousel `DX5F_-4Gbea` (May 2026): package hooks as a **hook library / swipe file** with a keyword CTA (“Comment HOOKS”) and a cover promise like “10 hooks that stop the scroll.” For Reels, this means hook posts should feel like a stealable asset, not generic advice: one hook shell per beat, each immediately adapted to Het’s niche.

The 10 reusable phrase shells:
1. “Nobody mentions this.”
2. “I wish I knew this earlier.”
3. “Pause for a second.”
4. “Ever notice this pattern?”
5. “Here’s the real truth.”
6. “Let me save you hours.”
7. “This may surprise you.”
8. “You need this now.”
9. “You may not agree with this.”
10. “I just figured this out.”

Why this works:
- Each shell creates a micro open-loop: hidden info, regret, interruption, pattern recognition, truth reveal, time-saving, surprise, urgency, disagreement, or fresh discovery.
- The list format is inherently save-worthy and lets the viewer quickly map each phrase to their own niche.
- The phrase alone is not enough; immediately follow with specificity: `Nobody mentions this: the best AI agent businesses are not selling agents — they are selling recovered time in one painful workflow.`
- Best use for Het: convert generic creator hooks into founder/operator versions by adding a concrete audience, pain, time horizon, or workflow.

### Platform-role matrix Reel: “Reels bring in, carousels teach, stories convert”
Learned from Aayush Swamy / @iamaayushswamy Reel `DWUCCNVjCYT` (Mar 25, 2026): a strong educational Reel can be a **role matrix** comparing 3 content formats against audience stage, objective, cadence, and content examples.

Reusable framework:
- Hook/central thesis: `Stories = followers + connection + leads`, `Carousels = engagement + education + saves/shares`, `Reels = non-followers + reach + education/storytelling + authority`.
- Use a persistent top header with the three categories (`STORY / CAROUSEL / REELS`) and highlight the active category in a contrast color on every beat. This reduces cognitive load while allowing fast pacing.
- Pair every claim with proof overlays: analytics screenshots, audience breakdowns, link clicks, saves/shares, story interactions, or post examples. The proof makes generic content-strategy advice feel earned.
- Beat order that worked: audience reached → business objective → trust/education role → posting cadence → concrete content examples.
- Suggested cadence from the Reel: Stories 2–3/day; carousels 2–3/week; Reels 3–6/week depending on style.
- Example ending taxonomy: Stories = personal life, client results, testimonials; Carousels = screenshotable guides/lists + client results; Reels = educational + storytelling content.

Adaptation for Het’s AI/tech/startup content:
- Reels: bring in cold founders/operators with story/news teardowns and useful AI workflow demos.
- Carousels: package the exact frameworks/checklists/prompt stacks people save and share.
- Stories: build trust with behind-the-scenes experiments, proof, polls, offers, and direct CTAs.
- For any “which channel/content type/tool should I use?” topic, use this matrix pattern: same persistent header, active highlight, metric/proof card, then concrete cadence/examples.

### Expectation vs reality storytelling loop
Learned from Kallaway / @kallawaymarketing Reel `DYkGzaYMdkC` (May 20, 2026): retention comes from repeatedly beating the viewer's expectation.

Use this loop inside scripts:
1. **Anchor expectation:** say something clear enough that the viewer can guess what is coming next.
2. **Beat expectation:** deliver a reality that is more interesting, shocking, contrarian, specific, or useful than the obvious guess.
3. **Repeat:** each beat should reset a new expectation, then exceed it again until the story/payoff completes.

Practical writing rule: if the next line is merely what the viewer already expects, rewrite it into a non-obvious mechanism, number, example, or contradiction.

AI/tech examples:
- Expected: “AI agents save time.” → Better reality: “The real win is not speed; it is turning forgotten follow-ups into automatic revenue recovery.”
- Expected: “OpenAI launched a new model.” → Better reality: “The model update matters less than the new workflow it unlocks for one-person SaaS teams.”
- Expected: “Use this AI tool.” → Better reality: “Use it only for the ugly middle step humans skip: turning messy notes into buyer-ready proof.”

Reusable thumbnail/cover pattern from the same Reel: `How to make BETTER [outcome]` + episode number + collage of proof/examples + visible transformation metric (`10K → 1.2M`) + human teacher frame. Use for recurring educational series like “How to make BETTER HOOKS ep 3” or “How to make BETTER AI DEMOS ep 2”.

### Dopamine Ladder retention framework
Learned from Kallaway / @kallawaymarketing Reel `DY4l4A5u4UG` (May 28, 2026) and extended by Kallaway YouTube video `jtmstMt4WLc`, “How to Become a Storytelling Genius (Dopamine Ladders)” (22:25, Nov 20 2025): treat high-retention content as a **ladder of dopamine states**, not just a hook plus information. The six rungs are `Stimulation → Captivation → Anticipation → Validation → Affection → Revelation`.

Core loop: `question → anticipation → answer → new question`. Great Reels repeatedly open a curiosity gap, delay the answer just enough, then pay it off with a non-obvious answer before opening the next gap.

Reusable writing model:
1. **Stimulation:** create a “visual stun gun” in the first 1–2 seconds — color, motion, brightness, contrast, attractive/expressive face, shocking visual, or unusual composition. This earns the stop before conscious comprehension; the long-form video frames it as bottom-up visual processing in roughly 200ms. Use a recognizable visual identity/palette/motion style, because copied visual patterns desensitize viewers.
2. **Captivation:** immediately implant an open question the viewer wants answered. Diagnose weak hooks by asking whether the question is (a) interesting/non-obvious enough and (b) relevant to the ideal viewer. A big question fails if the audience does not care; a relevant question fails if it is too obvious.
3. **Anticipation:** do not answer too quickly. Keep the viewer guessing by showing clues, partial frameworks, escalating levels, examples, misdirection/head fakes, or near-payoff proof. Anticipation is strongest when the viewer feels close to figuring it out; irrelevant complexity breaks the loop.
4. **Validation:** close the loop with a satisfying, non-obvious answer. For educational AI/tech content, validation is the practical insight, mechanism, or workflow the viewer can use. Do not leave major loops open; it creates frustration and lowers trust.
5. **Affection:** repeated good videos make the viewer like/trust the creator/messenger, not just the individual topic. Build affection with consistent POV, face, voice, taste, energy, smiles/passion, polished vibe, and repeatedly solving the viewer’s real problems.
6. **Revelation:** the highest rung is when the creator’s face/name itself becomes the hook — a Pavlovian expectation of value before the viewer watches. This comes from consistently hitting the first four rungs across many videos. First four rungs optimize the message/video; last two optimize the messenger/creator brand.

Visual structure to reuse:
- Alternate talking-head authority shots with clean explanatory graphics every few seconds.
- Use a persistent metaphor graphic — here, a red ladder with labeled rungs — so the framework feels concrete and save-worthy.
- Use white educational slides for examples/proof and dark talking-head shots for intimacy/authority; the contrast acts as an attention reset.
- Emphasize key phrases as bold all-caps labels in red/black blocks: `VISUAL STUN GUN`, `Ask interesting QUESTION`, `Give Non-Obvious ANSWER`.
- Show examples as small phone/post screenshots with arrows and labels; proof beats should appear immediately after each abstract claim.
- End with a keyword CTA that promises the deeper asset: `Comment “Dopamine” to get full video`.

Adaptation for Het’s AI/tech/startup content:
- Use this framework for educational meta-content, AI workflow breakdowns, and creator/business strategy videos.
- Example AI Reel ladder: stimulation = unusual AI output/UI collapse; captivation = “why do most AI demos feel fake?”; anticipation = reveal 3 demo layers; validation = “the problem is not the model, it is missing workflow proof”; affection = Het’s recurring builder/operator POV; revelation = repeated “Het explains the hidden system behind AI products” series.
- Before publishing, ask: what is the stun gun, what is the open question, how long do we delay the answer, and is the answer genuinely non-obvious?

## Script shape for Het's AI/tech/startup videos
1. **Hook:** compressed, tension-first line. Avoid generic AI hype.
2. **Pattern:** what the news/signal reveals.
3. **Proof:** 1–3 source-backed facts; avoid overclaiming.
4. **Founder lesson:** convert to product, career, or opportunity insight.
5. **Concrete examples:** names, workflows, numbers, before/after.
6. **Takeaway/CTA:** ask for a checklist, comment keyword, or save-worthy follow-up.

## Notion storage workflow for one-off scripts
When Het asks for a one-off Reel/TikTok/Short script, use this skill to write the script, then store it in Notion when access is available:
1. Target page: `Content Ideas`.
2. Section/database: `Individual ideas` for one-off scripts. Do not put one-off scripts under `Weeks`; `Weeks` is for weekly starting-date idea planning.
3. Create a new page named exactly `{topic} - {date}` using the current date unless Het specifies another date.
4. Put the full script inside that page, including topic/angle, visual hook, spoken script, on-screen text, shot list, caption, and source link if there is one.
5. If Notion access is blocked, draft the script in a local markdown file and clearly tell Het that Notion write is pending access/auth instead of pretending it was saved.

## Quality bar
- Optimize zero-follower posts for **watch time + shares/view**.
- Use plain language with founder/operator stakes.
- Prefer specific workflows over generic categories.
- Make the hook visually filmable, not just text overlay.
- Supporting visuals should avoid generic robot imagery; use UI mockups, workflows, diagrams, props, product teardown visuals, or a deliberate mascot system.
- For Greg Isenberg/Hyperagent-style warm editorial product motion design — off-white canvas, green/red/mauve semantic palette, serif + sans typography, stylized UI mockups, agent mascots, workflow diagrams — load `editorial-ai-product-design-system`.
- For TRIBE v2 / social-signal model analysis, distinguish **real hosted/API inference** from heuristic critique; never report model scores unless the model actually ran. See `references/tribev2-video-analysis.md` for Replicate and Hugging Face pitfalls.

## Common mistakes
- Starting with brand/news recap instead of viewer tension.
- Writing only spoken hooks and forgetting visual/SFX hooks.
- Using template-sounding “AI just changed forever” language.
- Treating every AI update as hype instead of extracting a usable founder lesson.
- Saving new Instagram lessons only in memory. Update this skill, or create a narrower skill if the lesson is a distinct reusable system.

## Evolving this skill
When Het shares a new Instagram Reel/post and says “learn this”:
1. Use `social-link-summarization` or browser/web extraction to capture public metadata, caption, preview image, and any accessible transcript/visual pattern.
2. If Instagram blocks normal scraping or only shows a login shell, use the fallback in `references/instagram-reel-learning-workflow.md`: `yt-dlp` metadata, manual format URL download if needed, FFmpeg contact sheet, local `faster_whisper` transcript, then pattern extraction.
3. Do not trust a generic local-video analysis response that says it cannot access the video; verify with frames/contact sheet plus transcript.
4. If a Reel/video is downloaded locally for analysis, extract the reusable pattern, patch the relevant skill, then delete the downloaded MP4/images/metadata artifacts unless Het explicitly asks to keep them. Do not let temporary Instagram media accumulate on disk.
5. If it improves Reels/hooks/scripts, patch this skill with a concise new rule or source-library note.
6. If it is about carousels, update `instagram-carousel` instead.
7. If it is a separate domain system, create a new skill and cross-reference it here.
8. Keep persistent memory minimal: store only a pointer/preference if necessary, not the full lesson.

## Extracting resource links from a Reel
When Het shares a Reel that lists tools/skills/repos/resources and asks for “all the links,” do not just summarize visible names. Use the link-list workflow in `references/instagram-reel-link-extraction.md`: capture metadata with `yt-dlp`, create contact sheets/full-size frames for OCR, search for companion posts/pages promised by the creator, parse install commands or repo slugs when available, verify repos with `git ls-remote`, then return a compact numbered table of names and canonical links. This is especially useful for fast slideshow Reels where many resources share one umbrella repo.

## Recalling previously shared Instagram resources
When Het asks what Instagram-shared projects/tools/repos he has already sent, use the recall workflow in `references/recalling-instagram-shared-resources.md`: search past sessions for direct `instagram.com/reel` user messages first, distinguish direct user shares from automated marketing research snippets, reuse prior extracted link tables when available, and label umbrella/list matches instead of overclaiming exact canonical repos. For “some” requests, return a compact high-confidence list rather than dumping every extracted item.
